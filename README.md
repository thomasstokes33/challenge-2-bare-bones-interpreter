This project aims to make
a <a href= "https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/student/wiki/w/COMP1202/Space_Cadets/SCChallengeBareBones">
bare bones</a> interpreter. The files that I'm currently working on are Executer and Parser. Parser is where main is so it runs first to check the syntax and setup loop pointers. After parsing, it will hopefully use an Executer object to actually run the code.
